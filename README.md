# Docker Swarm autoscaler for Azure

Here is autoscaler and node drainer for Azure. The idea is simple: you can use autoscale rules on CPU or another metrics inside VM scaleset. Azure uses _Cloud-init_ for VM provisioning, so, you can add nodes to a Swarm cluster automatically with _Custom data and cloud init_

## Cloud-init example (Ubuntu 20.04)

```
#cloud-config
apt:
  sources:
    docker:
      source: "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  focal stable"
      keyid: 9DC858229FC7DD38854AE2D88D81803C0EBFCD88
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - docker-ce
  - docker-ce-cli
  - containerd.io
runcmd:
  - sudo usermod -aG docker swarm
  - docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1n7dilf18jfyefv6f60n0ddnmavxoyq3ue8flfb4k2gfpj5fv7-5rohtvmhac6bf8dfpc3do481w 10.1.0.4:2377
```

The scaler have two functions:

- "Autoscale" replicas when cluster got more nodes
- Drain and delete nodes when cluster scales down

## Autoscaling

Because of various best practices and ways to treat your microservices in Swarm I choose a simple way to achieve "autoscaling", it's merely _config.yaml_ where you can define how much replicas per node you want to have. Inside an example below I have service "docs" with two replicas per node. So, when your cluster is going to scale up - scaler increase how much replicas do you have.

```
services:
  docs: 2

```
## Scale down, node draining and rm

When your cluster is going to scale down scaler recieve a message from [API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/scheduled-events) drain node and remove it from cluster. Take a look to sources when you have concern about graceful shutdown timing. By default it is 30 seconds. 

## Prerequisites and some limitations: 

1) Azure has its own rules about hostnames and vm names. I expect your VMSS will have name like `swarm-xxx` where xxx could be a region or etc. 
2) You should change trigger event in sources if you would like to use SpotVM. 
3) By default config file location is `/home/config.yaml`

## How to deploy

```
docker service create --mode global --constraint node.role==manager --mount src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind --name scaler --config source=config.yaml,target=/home/config.yaml codeandmedia/swarm-azure-scaler:latest
```

You may use my image for test purposes, but I highly reccomend to customize image and sources for your cluster.
